# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

* There are 5 sections currently visible via navbar on the landing page.
This can be easily extended by adding **1 line code**  to the DOMContentLoaded event function call -

    <em>createSection('sectionId', 'sectionName');<em>

    For ex. to add a 6th section, just add -
    createSection('section6', 'Section 6');


 * The section where user is will be Active

 * Clicking on the menu item will lead to respective section
