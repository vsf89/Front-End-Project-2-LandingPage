* There are 5 sections currently visible via navbar on the landing page.

    *createSection('sectionId', 'sectionName');*

    For ex. to add a 6th section, just add -
    createSection('section6', 'Section 6');


 * The section where user is will be Active

 * Clicking on the menu item will lead to respective section
